# Bayesian-adaptive-clinical-trial
Simulation and Bayesian analysis of an adaptive clinical trial for a new drug, showcasing GLM fitting, experimental design, and hypothesis testing.
Project Overview/Abstract: What problem does this project solve? What skills does it showcase?
"This project demonstrates the design, simulation, and Bayesian analysis of an adaptive Phase II clinical trial for a hypothetical new analgesic drug. It showcases expertise in statistical modeling, experimental design, and the application of Bayesian inference for data-driven decision making in pharmaceutical research."
Key Features/Skills Demonstrated: List the specific skills as bullet points.
* Bayesian Analysis (PyMC): Prior elicitation, posterior inference, credible intervals, adaptive trial design.
* Multimodal Data Integration: Incorporating patient demographics, baseline pain scores, and simulated biomarker data.
* Generalized Linear Model (GLM) Fitting: Modeling continuous outcomes with relevant covariates.
* Experimental Design Principles: Adaptive trial stages, interim analysis, early stopping rules.
* Hypothesis Testing: Bayesian hypothesis testing for treatment efficacy and safety signals.
* Python Programming: Data simulation, statistical modeling, visualization.
Problem Statement / Background: Briefly explain the clinical need or challenge the project addresses (e.g., accelerating drug development, efficient resource allocation).
Data Simulation: Explain why you simulated data and how it was done.
"Due to the proprietary nature of real clinical trial data, this project utilizes a comprehensive simulated dataset designed to mimic a Phase II trial for chronic pain. The simulation incorporates realistic patient demographics, baseline measurements, and a primary outcome of pain reduction."
Methodology:
Briefly explain Bayesian GLM.
Briefly explain adaptive trial design logic (interim analysis, stopping rules).
Mention PyMC and ArviZ.
Project Structure: A simple tree representation is good.

How to Run the Project: Clear instructions for someone else to replicate your work.
git clone ...
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook and open the .ipynb file.
Results and Discussion: Summarize your key findings from the simulation (e.g., "The adaptive design successfully stopped the trial early for efficacy in X% of simulations, with an average patient enrollment of Y compared to Z for a fixed design."). Include screenshots of key plots (posterior distributions, trial history, multi-sim results).
Future Work/Improvements: What could be added or improved? Shows forward-thinking.
